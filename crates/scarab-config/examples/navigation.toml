# Navigation Configuration Example
# Demonstrates all available navigation options including keymaps and plugin conflict resolution

[navigation]
# Navigation style: "vimium", "cosmos", or "spacemacs"
# - vimium: f for hints, Esc to cancel, letter keys for selection
# - cosmos: Space as leader key, then navigation submodes
# - spacemacs: SPC prefix for commands
style = "vimium"

# Plugin conflict resolution flags
# Set to false if you have plugins that conflict with navigation features

# Allow plugins to trigger hint mode (default: true)
# Set to false if you have a plugin that conflicts with hint mode
allow_plugin_hint_mode = true

# Allow plugins to register focusable elements (default: true)
# Set to false to prevent plugins from adding custom focusables
allow_plugin_focusables = true

# Custom keybindings override the defaults for the selected style
# Format: action_name = "Key+Modifier"
[navigation.keybindings]
# Mode transitions
enter_hints = "Ctrl+F"          # Enter hint mode for link selection
enter_copy = "Ctrl+Shift+C"     # Enter copy mode for text selection
enter_search = "Ctrl+Slash"     # Enter search mode
enter_command_palette = "Ctrl+P" # Open command palette
exit_mode = "Escape"            # Exit current mode, return to parent
cancel = "Ctrl+G"               # Cancel all modes, return to Normal

# Prompt navigation (jumping between shell prompts)
prev_prompt = "Ctrl+Up"         # Jump to previous shell prompt
next_prompt = "Ctrl+Down"       # Jump to next shell prompt

# Hint mode actions
activate_hint = "Enter"         # Activate selected hint

# Copy mode actions
copy_mode_toggle_selection = "Space"  # Toggle visual selection
copy_mode_exit = "y"                  # Exit copy mode and copy selection

# Search actions
search_forward = "/"            # Search forward
search_backward = "?"           # Search backward
next_search_match = "n"         # Next match
prev_search_match = "N"         # Previous match (Shift+n)

# Command palette actions
execute_command = "Enter"       # Execute selected command
filter_commands = "Ctrl+F"      # Filter command list


# Example: Cosmos style configuration
# [navigation]
# style = "cosmos"
# [navigation.keybindings]
# enter_hints = "Space+f"
# enter_copy = "Space+c"
# enter_search = "Space+/"


# Example: Spacemacs style configuration
# [navigation]
# style = "spacemacs"
# [navigation.keybindings]
# enter_hints = "Space+s+f"
# enter_copy = "Space+c+c"
# command_palette = "Space+Space"


# Example: Disable plugin navigation features
# [navigation]
# style = "vimium"
# allow_plugin_hint_mode = false
# allow_plugin_focusables = false
