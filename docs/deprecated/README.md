# Deprecated Documentation

This folder contains outdated documentation files that have been superseded by newer, more comprehensive documentation. These files are kept for historical reference only and should not be used for current development or usage guidance.

## Purpose

Files in this directory fall into one or more of these categories:

1. **Superseded Documentation** - Replaced by more comprehensive or restructured guides
2. **Point-in-Time Reports** - Completion reports and summaries from specific development phases
3. **Historical Analysis** - Legacy architectural analysis from earlier development stages

## Finding Current Documentation

For current, maintained documentation, please see:

- **[Documentation Index](../README.md)** - Central hub for all current documentation
- **[mdBook Portal](../book/)** - Comprehensive user and developer guide
- **[Plugin Development Guide](../plugin-development/README.md)** - Current plugin development documentation
- **[Architecture Overview](../developer/architecture.md)** - Current system architecture
