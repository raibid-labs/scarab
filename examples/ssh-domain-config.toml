# SSH Domain Examples
# Multiple SSH domains can be configured for different servers

# Example 1: Development server with SSH agent authentication
[[ssh_domains]]
id = "dev"
name = "Development Server"
host = "dev.example.com"
port = 22
user = "developer"
auth_type = "agent"
connect_timeout = 10
forward_agent = false
remote_cwd = "/home/developer/projects"

# Example 2: Production server with public key authentication
[[ssh_domains]]
id = "prod"
name = "Production Server"
host = "prod.example.com"
port = 22
user = "admin"
auth_type = "publickey"
key_path = "/home/user/.ssh/prod_key"
# passphrase = "optional_passphrase"  # Uncomment if key is encrypted
connect_timeout = 15
forward_agent = false
remote_cwd = "/var/www"

# Example 3: Jump host with agent forwarding
[[ssh_domains]]
id = "jumphost"
name = "Jump Host"
host = "jump.datacenter.com"
port = 22
user = "ops"
auth_type = "agent"
connect_timeout = 10
forward_agent = true  # Forward agent to access other servers from jump host

# Example 4: Testing server on non-standard port
[[ssh_domains]]
id = "test"
name = "Test Server"
host = "test.internal"
port = 2222
user = "tester"
auth_type = "agent"
connect_timeout = 5

# Example 5: Legacy server with password auth (not recommended for production)
# [[ssh_domains]]
# id = "legacy"
# name = "Legacy Server"
# host = "legacy.oldnetwork.com"
# user = "legacy_user"
# auth_type = "password"
# password = "changeme"  # Use environment variable instead: ${LEGACY_PASSWORD}

# Usage:
# 1. Start Scarab: scarab-client
# 2. Open command palette: Ctrl+Shift+P
# 3. Select "New Pane in Domain"
# 4. Choose domain: local, dev, prod, jumphost, or test
# 5. Pane spawns in selected domain

# Tips:
# - Use SSH agent for best security and convenience
# - Set up SSH config (~/.ssh/config) for host aliases
# - Test SSH connection manually before configuring domain
# - Use remote_cwd to set working directory for new panes
# - Enable forward_agent only when necessary (security consideration)
